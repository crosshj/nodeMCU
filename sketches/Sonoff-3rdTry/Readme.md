THIS WORKS!

Followed instructions here:
https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/wiki/Arduino-IDE

Created a batch file that does copies files where they need copied.

I ran this patch.bat both BEFORE first arduino.exe run and AFTER the step where installing ESP8266 lib in interface.

Connect FTDI -> Sonoff using cable order [ RED | GREEN | WHITE | BLACK ]

I was not able to get user_config.h to stick, but WPS setup worked.  Will revisit this.

As it stands now, I can emulate Wemo.  So I can use this setup going forward for a while.
