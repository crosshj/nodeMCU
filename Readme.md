UDP / SSDP

GOALS / IDEAS
-------------

- motion sensor / temp monitor for room presence and logging (use UDP)

- switch (moderately interested as a fallback from presence sensing)

- smart outlet (using commercial device that speaks some unknown radio frequency)

- wifi footprint reader(s), how do human bodies change wifi signals?

- car presence using wifi footprint (which SSID's are near)

- attach an SD card

- use ESP-12E as a ESP8266 writer

- LED with 3D printed sculpture - art, fun, notifications, cheerlight, etc
